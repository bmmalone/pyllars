Introduction to pyllars
***********************

This package contains many supporting utilities I find useful for Python 3.

History
-------

This project was called `pymisc-utils`. Due to significant changes in the API
when moving from version `0.2.11` to version `1.0.0`, the name was also
changed to avoid confusion. The new name is also more fun... "pyllars",
"**supporting** utilities".... I'm here all week folks, try the veal.
