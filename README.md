# pymisc-utils
This project contains many python3 scripts and helpers that I find useful.

**Install**

This package is written in python3. pip can be used to install it:

``pip3 install .``

(The "period" at the end is required.)

If possible, I recommend installing inside a virtual environment. See 
[here](http://www.simononsoftware.com/virtualenv-tutorial-part-2/>), for example.
